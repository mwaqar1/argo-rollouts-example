# AKS-ArgoCD-ArgoRollouts-POC

## Overview

This proof-of-concept (POC) project showcases the integration of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts to demonstrate advanced Kubernetes deployment and progressive delivery strategies. The project provides a comprehensive hands-on guide for setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying applications using GitOps methodologies, and implementing progressive delivery methods such as canary releases and blue-green deployments.

## Project Description

The AKS-ArgoCD-ArgoRollouts-POC project aims to illustrate the powerful capabilities of combining AKS, Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts in managing and deploying applications within a Kubernetes environment. By leveraging these tools, the project demonstrates how to achieve seamless continuous deployment and advanced deployment strategies, ensuring high availability and minimized risks during application updates.

### Key Objectives

1. **Install and Connect to AKS:**
   - Guide users through the installation and configuration of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
   - Establish connections to the Kubernetes console, setting the stage for further deployments.

2. **Deploy Applications with Argo CD:**
   - Showcase the process of installing Argo CD on AKS and deploying applications.
   - Highlight the benefits of GitOps methodologies, such as improved version control, auditability, and automated deployments.

3. **Demonstrate Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts:**
   - Implement Argo Rollouts to demonstrate progressive delivery methods, such as canary releases or blue/green deployments.
   - Showcase advanced deployment strategies in Kubernetes, focusing on minimizing risks and ensuring smooth transitions during updates.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Setup Guide:**
  - Step-by-step instructions for setting up AKS and establishing a connection to the Kubernetes console.

- **Argo CD Deployment and Usage:**
  - Detailed walkthrough on installing Argo CD, setting up a repository, and deploying a sample application.

- **Progressive Delivery Demonstration:**
  - Instructions and examples for using Argo Rollouts to execute progressive delivery strategies in a controlled and monitored environment.

### What the Project Does

- **Automated Application Deployment:**
  - Leverages Argo CD to automate the deployment process, ensuring that the application is deployed consistently and reliably every time changes are made to the codebase.

- **Progressive Delivery:**
  - Utilizes Argo Rollouts to implement progressive delivery techniques, allowing for controlled and monitored releases of new application versions.
  - Demonstrates canary releases, where a small percentage of traffic is initially directed to the new version to verify its stability before gradually increasing the traffic.
  - Implements blue/green deployments, where the new version is deployed alongside the old version, and traffic is switched over once the new version is verified to be stable.

- **Monitoring and Metrics:**
  - Integrates with metric providers like Prometheus, to monitor the health and performance of the application during deployments.
  - Utilizes custom metrics and KPIs to drive automated promotion or rollback decisions, ensuring that the application meets predefined performance and reliability criteria.

- **Rollback and Promotion:**
  - Demonstrates automated rollback capabilities, where the system can revert to a stable version if the new version fails to meet the required criteria.
  - Implements manual and automated promotion processes, allowing for controlled progression through deployment stages based on real-time monitoring and analysis.
